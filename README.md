Predictive Analysis - Breast Cancer Prediction Model 

Predictive Analysis - It defined as a data mining area made to predict unknown future events by collecting data and performing statistics and deployment processes.

For any data analysis process we used to follow following process- 
define problem, data collection, data cleaning, data anslysis, build predictive model, validate model and deployment

PROBLEM : Implement predictive analysis usig R to diagnose whether or not a person hasd breast cancer, based on past medical data.

DATA SOURCE OR COLLECTION: university of california, Irvine(UCI) data set of breast cancer cases which used to build apredictive model that classifies a tumour as either mailgnant or benign based on vertian feaure varibale

DATA CLEANING: We used some existing functions like na.omit to clean the data.

After cleaning data we divide the data set into training and test data set. After that we apply KNN a algorithm (K nearest neighbourer) on both training and testing data set which help again to predict which is malignant (dangerous) and benign (lower compare to other) cancer. by this way we do the predictive analysis.
